# PUMP.FUN SNIPER BOT - USER GUIDE FOR BEGINNERS

## WHAT IS THIS BOT?

This is a Solana-based automated trading bot that helps you purchase new tokens immediately after they launch on Pump.fun, and automatically sells them based on your settings. This can help you get in early on promising tokens and take profits automatically.

## GETTING STARTED (QUICK START)

1. Configure your wallet(s)
2. Set your buy amount(s)
3. Set your sell conditions
4. Start the bot with a token address

## DETAILED STEPS

### Step 1: Configure Your Wallet

1. Click on "Configuration" in the sidebar
2. Open the "Wallet Settings" tab
3. Enter your Solana wallet private key(s)
   - You can add up to 4 different wallets
   - Click "Test" to verify your wallet is working
   - IMPORTANT: Keep your private keys secure and never share them!

### Step 2: Set Buy Amounts

1. Open the "Buy Amounts" tab in Configuration
2. Set the amount of SOL you want to spend for each wallet
   - Recommended for beginners: Start with small amounts like 0.01 SOL
   - Each wallet can have a different buy amount

### Step 3: Configure Sell Conditions

1. Open the "Sell Conditions" tab in Configuration
2. Set your profit target percentage (e.g., 50%)
3. Set timeout in seconds (max time before forced sell)
4. Set minimum buyer count (sell when this many people buy)
5. Click "Save Configuration" at the bottom of the page

### Step 4: Starting the Bot

1. Get the token address (mint address) from Pump.fun
2. Enter the token address in the "Bot Control" section
3. Click "Start Bot"
4. Monitor the "Transaction History" section to see your trades

## TESTING MODE (RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS)

Before using real funds, test the bot's functionality:

1. Click the "Test Mode" tab in the Bot Control section
2. Select a test scenario (Buy & Sell, Buy Only, or Sell Only)
3. Click "Run Test"
4. Check the Transaction History to see simulated transactions

## ADDITIONAL SETTINGS

- **RPC URL**: The Solana network connection (default should work fine)
- **Slippage**: How much price movement you'll accept (5-10% recommended)
- **Buy Delay**: Time between buying with multiple wallets

## TIPS FOR BEGINNERS

1. Start with Test Mode to understand how the bot works
2. Use small amounts (0.001-0.01 SOL) for your first real trades
3. Be cautious with new tokens - many can be scams or have high volatility
4. Monitor your profit/loss and adjust settings accordingly
5. Keep your private keys secure - never share them with anyone

## TROUBLESHOOTING

- If a wallet shows "Error" when testing, check that:
  - The private key is entered correctly
  - The wallet has some SOL for transaction fees
  - The Solana network is operating normally

- If the bot fails to buy/sell:
  - Check your wallet balances
  - Verify the token address is valid
  - Ensure your slippage is sufficient (10% recommended)

## WARNINGS

- Cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk
- Only trade with funds you can afford to lose
- The bot cannot guarantee profits
- Always do your own research on tokens before trading
